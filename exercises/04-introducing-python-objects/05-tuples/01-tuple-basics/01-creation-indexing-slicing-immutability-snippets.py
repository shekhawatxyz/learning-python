# Tuples: Creation, Indexing, Slicing, Immutability — Snippets

# --- Snippet 1 ---
# Basic tuple creation, indexing, slicing, membership

t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

print(t[0])
print(t[-1])
print(t[1:3])
print(len(t))
print(3 in t)

# Your answer:


# --- Snippet 2 ---
# Mixed-type tuple, nested access, concatenation, repetition

t = (1, "hello", [3, 4])

print(t[1])
print(t[2][0])
print(type(t))
print(t + (5, 6))
print(t * 2)
