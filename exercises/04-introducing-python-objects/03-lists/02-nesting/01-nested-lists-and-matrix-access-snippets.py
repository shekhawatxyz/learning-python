# Step 1: Nested lists and matrix access
# Work through each snippet and predict the output before running.

# --- Snippet 1 ---
# Explores: nested list (matrix) creation, double indexing, negative indexing
# within nested lists, arithmetic on nested elements

M = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(M[0])
print(M[1][2])
print(M[2][-1])
print(M[0][0] + M[2][2])

# Your answer:

# --- Snippet 2 ---
# Explores: nested lists as records/rows, accessing components of records

data = [["Alice", 90], ["Bob", 85], ["Charlie", 92]]
print(data[1])
print(data[1][0])
print(data[2][1])
print(data[0][1] + data[1][1])

# Your answer:
