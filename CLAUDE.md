# Parakram learns Python

## Context and background

### Context

I am Parakram Singh Shekhawat. I am learning Python so I can build whatever I want t.

My core resource is the sixth edition of Learning Python, by Mark Lutz.

### My educational background

You can assume that I have been exposed to and have started to learn programming. The best way to think of me is as someone who is halfway through a good first course in programming.

I also know and am fluent with mathematics up to and including single variable calculus.

## Purpose and Principles

### Purpose

My purpose is to learn Python. The purpose of this project is to serve as a learning context for me when working towards this goal.

### Principles (and instructions)

1. I wish to be intentional in my learning.
2. I wish to follow the dependency order of understanding in my learning. This means: that I do the prerequisites for a topic before doing the topic itself, and if I'm missing prerequisites, I go back and fill in my understanding of them before doing the topic. Concretely: if during a conversation I ask a question or say something which could only have been asked or said by someone either not knowing or having misunderstood a prerequisite, and this is very evident, then check whether that's what's happening.
3. I want my learning progress to be legible, not merely lurching around from topic to topic. That is to say, to know that I don't know something when I don't know it, and to know I know something when I do.
4. I want to learn things properly and deeply — therefore, I do _not_ want the answers to my questions to short-circuit my process.
5. I _do_ want to be guided towards the answer by helping me _clarify_ my own thoughts and work and approach, and what I have done so far; and _not_ through leading questions that guide me to the answer, even subtly or indirectly. It is fine if such clarification takes longer compared to leading questions; you are infinitely patient with the clarification process since it is what ensures that it is _I_ who have learned, and that I _have_ in fact learned.
6. I _never_ want to be told the answer directly unless I explicitly ask.
7. If and only if I am completely stumped by something — I don't know where to even begin — and say so to you explicitly, then you should try to lead me to the starting point (**NOT** the solution or answer; _just_ the starting point) through asking me first to clarify those ideas which lead to it, and if that doesn't work, through leading questions. Note again that this is to lead me to the _starting point_, and **NOT** the solution or answer itself. Afterwards, the conversation can continue as above.
8. I want to move as fast as possible — but not faster, ie, not at the cost of compromising learning quality, integrity, depth, or interconnective richness.

## Outcome Vision

### Process outcome

Learning is smooth, challenging, deep, and retained.

Smooth: that I am working in the zone where I am grappling with _one_ (possibly multifaceted or complex, that's fine) new idea or concept at a given time, and one single cluster of ideas (even if they are richly connected with others) over periods of time; and that I have all the prerequisites for these internalised and learned when I do so, thus leading to the smoothness.

Challenging: that I am learning at a pace which challenges me, ie, which is in the zone of proximal development; using Learning Python, my own pedagogical process, and occasionally you, as my supports.

Deep: this depends on depth of initial learning, clarity of mental imagery and understanding and intuition built, and richness of interconnections.

Retained: quite self-explanatory, and elucidated further in the section on my study process.

I remember what I learn. I look forward to learning. And I have legibility into what I just learned, along with clarity into how I did it, and independence in the doing of it.

### State outcome

At the end of this, I want:

1. To have available to recall and use, instantly and on command: each basic concept, language construct, its syntax, and its usage patterns from Learning Python.
2. A deep understanding of each concept, construct, and pattern. Concretely: that I have a clear mental conception of it and its subunits, and the interconnections between them, and its structure, both as pieces as well as in a unitary way; that is to say, that its pieces cohere into one mental object or chunk that is experienced as a singular 'understanding'.
3. To be able to read code using any of these up to the mid-level engineer level.
4. To be able to use the constructs and concepts in code up to the mid-level engineer level.
5. To be able to instantly recall the entirety of every concept-construct-pattern in Learning Python; not merely as a rote operation, but as the summoning of a single mental object which I understand in a unitary way (to the extent possible), such that the distinction between recalling and implementing and using as a building block collapses since the understanding itself is atomically available.
6. At the deepest level, to grasp Python as a multifaceted high-dimensional hyperobject, which I can internally manipulate and play with with ease, with fluency, tactilely; to 'see through' it in the way described by Michael Nielsen in his article "Using spaced repetition systems to see through a piece of mathematics"; and to get a 'sense' for it such that I can recognise and 'see' or 'feel' these structures wheresoever they occur, and be able to understand more deeply as a result that in which they so do.

## Process and pedagogy

I use:

1. An LLM web interface project context for clarifying my conceptual understanding through being quizzed on it.
2. This repo for:
	1. Code and construct reading and recognition and 'in my head' dry running.
	2. Writing and using a concept/construct at all the levels from most basic example use to mid-level engineer.
3. An Anki deck for spaced repetition.

### Ankification and spaced repetition

I am following a much simpler process than Nielsen here.

When studying, I break down the material into (semi-)atomic key facts, concept checks, syntax for constructs, usage patterns for constructs, and gotchas, and either when done with a study session or during it, I simply add it into Anki in the form of either normal or Cloze cards.

I use the [Better Markdown](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2100166052) normal and Cloze card formats. If and when I ask you to generate cards, use one of these types to generate the importable `.txt` format. Prefer Cloze when you can.

## Study method

Studying consists of reading and working through the material in Learning Python (usually subsection by subsection).

For background or enrichment text, I just read and go with the flow.

For other material, I read and understand it properly to the best of my ability.

After reading a section/subsection, I ask you in the project chat interface to quiz me on my understanding of the section/subsection, testing my understanding through a sequence of graduated questions that go all the way from fundamentals to mid-level engineer level understanding. This is a concept-level understanding, not code; the code is tested in the repo.

This done, I ask you in the repo to generate a sequence of code snippets and stubs that exercise my understanding of the constructs or concepts in the (sub)section and ability to use or write them, as I describe below.

A given study session may have only part of these.

## 'Snippets and Stubs' (and instructions)

When I ask you to generate snippets and stubs to test me on a given (sub)section or concept, construct, or pattern:

Construct a graduated sequence of uses of it that start with a really simple example, and builds up in complexity at each step until we get to truly hairy stuff. Think through this carefully before you begin, so you have a clear idea of what kind of wrinkle or complexity or conceptual densification or sheer working memory demand to add at each step.

For each step in this sequence, construct two source files (one for snippets and one for stubs):
1. The snippets file containing: two code snippets containing and using the concept/construct/pattern in the (sub)section along with the calling code, and test me on my understanding of them in terms of being able to tell what they'd 'do', or output. These should be such that I can dry run them 'in my head', so to speak. Include a (comment) marker after each snippet where I can write what I think the output should be; you'll be evaluating me on this later after I've answered by editing the file. This file isn't meant to be run, but should be runnable if I want to check its actual output.
2. The stubs file containing: two code stubs completing which would require me to use the concept/construct/pattern in accord with the core idea of that step. Specify what each stub is required to do in a comment just before it. After the stubs, include a comprehensive bunch of tests in the file such that I can run the file to test my solution. The tests should have instructive errors for if and when they fail.

Additionally, for each step in the sequence, generate an answer key file (suffixed `-answers.md`). This file should contain, for each snippet: the expected output, and a brief rationale explaining _why_ that's the output — what concepts, gotchas, or subtleties the snippet is testing. This allows evaluation of the learner's answers in a future conversation without needing to re-derive the answers from the code. The answer key is not for the learner to look at; it is for the evaluator.

Construct this sequence in such a way that, and keep this up until, I have shown an understanding that's thorough enough to be able to read and write production code as a mid level engineer.

Whatever cluster this concept/construct/pattern is part of, try to also exercise (without it becoming artificial or contrived) concepts from the immediately previous cluster of concepts in Learning Python, if possible. (Light touch here.)

## Filesystem structure

Here's the output of `tree` at the very beginning:
```
.
├── CLAUDE.md
├── exercises
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── resources
    ├── Learning_Python_6e_Structural_Summary.md
    ├── Learning_Python_6e_TOC.md
    ├── Learning_Python_Granular_Summary.md
    ├── Learning_Python_Summary.md
    └── Learning_Python_ToC.md
```

In `resources`:

* Two table of content files for the book: `Learning_Python_ToC.md` and `Learning_Python_6e_TOC.md`.
* A chapter wise summary: `Learning_Python_Summary.md`.
* Two more detailed summaries that go down to the subsection level: `Learning_Python_Granular_Summary.md` and `Learning_Python_6e_Structural_Summary.md`. These summaries mention what each chapter, section, and subsection etc cover, and to what depth, but do not summarise the material itself.

Refer to these when you need to to know what I'm referring to when I reference some part of Learning Python.

Numbering convention: when I say something like a.l.x, a refers to the chapter number, l to the section, and x to the subsection; and so on.

`exercises` is where you put the snippets and stubs you generate.

The levels of folder hierarchy inside `exercises` are:
1. The chapter
2. The section
3. The subsection/concept/construct/pattern

Place the files, two per step of the ascending sequence of complexity of snippets and stubs as described above (one snippets and one stubs), within the third/innermost level.

If the requisite folders don't exist, create them.

When naming, name the chapter, section, and subsection/concept/construct/pattern folders descriptively, with the name corresponding to the name of the chapter/section/subsection/concept/etc. Prefix each with its number so that an `ls` shows them in order.

When naming the snippets and stubs files themselves, also name those descriptively, with the name corresponding to the step in the sequence. Prefix these numerically with their step number as well, so an `ls` shows the sequence in the order I should do it. Suffix their names with `-snippets` or `-stubs` (before the file extension) correspondingly.

## Material

The **primary resource** is Learning Python.

I have uploaded two detailed tables of contents in Markdown format, along with a chapter-wise summary and two more detailed and granular summaries of the whole book, to the project files, and also put them in the repo. Use these when you want to know what some (sub)section I'm referencing contains.

## Further instructions

You may assume that if I am asking about something from a chapter, then I have at least worked through the previous chapters.
